# cloud-performance
=================

Scripts for a simple demonstration and to test the performance of the Rackspace Cloud API (and maybe others as well later).

## firstgen-cs-performance.py

  The code is base on [ python-cloudservers ] (https://github.com/rackspace/python-cloudservers)

Additional documentation or rather some issues I run into when developing the code can be found on my blog here:

 * [ racksapce label ] ( http://rtomaszewski.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/rackspace )
 * [ cloudserver label ] ( http://rtomaszewski.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/cloudserver )

## nova-cs-performance.py

  The code is base on [ python-novaclient ] (https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient)
